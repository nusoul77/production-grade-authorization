Write a simple REST application from the scratch:

- CRUD for username/password authentication of the only one admin.
- CRUD for user management.
- Design a secure production-grade authorization logic.
- NestJS-like frameworks are not allowed. Use Express directly.
- ES2020+ features are required. Source code can be TS or JS.
- Database can be MongoDB (preferred) or SQL.
- Mongoose is not allowed. Use "mongodb" driver instead.
- Dependency injection is required. At least one unit test is recommended.
- Project must contain Docker Compose for local development. Production one is recommended.
